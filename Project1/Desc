Analyze NYSE Data:
In this project, I used statistics and spreadsheet program (Microsoft Excel) to analyze data from over 500 companies on the New York Stock Exchange. 
I also forecasted financial metrics based on three possible scenarios for a company of my choice from the NYSE dataset.

This project contained 3 tasks:
1)	Identify the question about the data that you will answer based on your data analysis.
-	The question should include at least one categorical variable (GICS Sector or GICS Sub Industry) and one quantitative variable (one of the financial metrics) 
and require the use of at least one of the summary statistics.
-	A tab within the Excel spreadsheet should include the summary statistics [measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median) and measures of spread 
(standard deviation and range)] that used to answer the question.
-	A slide presentation.

2)	Create a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list.
The drop-down list should pull historical fundamentals data to create the P&L Statement.
The P&L statement should include the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT values for all the years there is historical data available for that company in the dataset.

3)	Create a financial model for a company (different from Task 2) that forecasts out the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for two more years 
using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case and Base case).
The assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin and operating margin should change for each scenario.
The forecasting model should be dynamic for the selection of the case (Weak, Base, Strong).
