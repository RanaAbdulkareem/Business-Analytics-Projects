During my learning journey with Udacity as a Business Analytics student

I built 3 projects:


Project1: 
Analyze NYSE Data

In this project, I used statistics and spreadsheet program (Microsoft Excel) to analyze data from over 500 companies on the New York Stock Exchange. I also forecasted financial metrics based on three possible scenarios for a company of my choice from the NYSE dataset.


Project2:
Query a Digital Music Store Database

In this project, I queried a digital music store database which holds information regarding the storeâ€™s media, employees, and customers. I used the database to help the store gain an understanding of the types of music that are purchased, country that has most purchase rate, and the classification of customers depending on their spending.

Project3: 
Build Data Dashboards

In this project, I built interactive dashboards with Tableau and used them to discover and communicate insights from data. I used a dataset of US Census Demographic Data, fined the number of men & women in US, poverty & unemployment, total population and citizen.
