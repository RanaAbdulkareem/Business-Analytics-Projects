During my learning journey with Udacity as a Business Analytics student

I created 3 projects:


Project1: Analyze NYSE Data

In this project, I used statistics and spreadsheet program (Microsoft Excel) to analyze data from over 500 companies on the New York Stock Exchange. I also forecasted financial metrics based on three possible scenarios for a company of my choice from the NYSE dataset.

This project contained 3 tasks:
1)	Identify the question about the data that you will answer based on your data analysis.
-	The question should include at least one categorical variable (GICS Sector or GICS Sub Industry) and one quantitative variable (one of the financial metrics) and require the use of at least one of the summary statistics.
-	A tab within the Excel spreadsheet should include the summary statistics [measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median) and measures of spread (standard deviation and range)] that used to answer the question.
-	A slide presentation.

2)	Create a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list.
The drop-down list should pull historical fundamentals data to create the P&L Statement.
The P&L statement should include the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT values for all the years there is historical data available for that company in the dataset.

3)	Create a financial model for a company (different from Task 2) that forecasts out the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for two more years using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case and Base case).
The assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin and operating margin should change for each scenario.
The forecasting model should be dynamic for the selection of the case (Weak, Base, Strong). 


Project2: Query a Digital Music Store Database

In this project, I queried a digital music store database which holds information regarding the storeâ€™s media, employees, and customers. I used the database to help the store gain an understanding of the types of music that are purchased, country that has most purchase rate, and the classification of customers depending on their spending.

Project3: Build Data Dashboards

In this project, I built interactive dashboards with Tableau and used them to discover and communicate insights from data. I used a dataset of US Census Demographic Data, fined the number of men & women in US, poverty & unemployment, total population and citizen.
